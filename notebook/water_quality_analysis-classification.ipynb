    "#### **Project Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the critical domain of environmental monitoring and public health, rapid and accurate water quality analysis is essential for preventing pollution-related hazards and ensuring ecosystem sustainability. This project focuses on analyzing 222+ water sample records to identify key physicochemical factors influencing Water Quality Classes. Using advanced machine learning techniques, the project predicts quality grades (Class A-E) and provides actionable insights to automate pollution detection and optimize resource allocation for water treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dataset Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains water quality monitoring data from various regional sampling stations. It includes key attributes such as physical properties (Temperature, pH, Conductivity, Turbidity), chemical indicators (Dissolved Oxygen, BOD, COD, Nitrates, Sulphates), and biological parameters (Coliform counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable is **Use Based Class**, a categorical label classifying water suitability ranging from **Class A (Drinking Source without conventional treatment)** to **Class E (Irrigation/Industrial Cooling)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analysis Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project follows a systematic machine learning workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and refined the raw dataset using median imputation for numerical columns, label encoding for categorical markers, and standard scaling to normalize sensor ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature Engineering:** Created 4+ new attributes (e.g., BOD/COD Ratio, pH Deviation, Pollution Index) to capture complex chemical interactions and improve model interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Building:** Developed classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict the five Water Quality classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Evaluation:** Selected the best-performing model (XGBoost) with a focus on Weighted F1 Score and Accuracy (94.4%), as these metrics ensure robust performance across all classes, specifically addressing the class imbalance which was mitigated using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).\n"
